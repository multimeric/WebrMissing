You may be interested to find which packages are compatible with WebR, which powers shinylive.
Specifically you are probably interested in which *common* packages are not available, since they are more likely to impact you.

This notebook demonstrates how to easily query this information, and includes a sorted list of such packages.

First we find packages that have WASM versions:
```{R}
avail <- available.packages(
    contriburl = "https://repo.r-wasm.org/bin/emscripten/contrib/4.4"
) |>
    tibble::as_tibble() |>
    dplyr::pull(Package)
```

Next, we need a list of all packages on CRAN:
```{R}
all <- available.packages() |>
    tibble::as_tibble() |>
    dplyr::pull(Package)
```

Finally, we can take the difference between these to get packages that aren't available in WASM.
Then we can look up their popularity by number of downloads:
```{R}
#| results: "asis"
unavailable <- setdiff(all, avail)
popularity <- unavailable |>
    # Split the unavailable packages into groups of 500, since `cranlogs` can't handle longer vectors
    seq_along() |>
    {`/`}(500) |>
    ceiling() |>
    split(unavailable, f = _) |>
    # Get the popularity of each package
    purrr::map(cranlogs::cran_downloads, when="last-month") |>
    purrr::list_rbind() |>
    tibble::as_tibble() |> 
    dplyr::select(package, count) |>
    dplyr::summarise(count = sum(count), .by = package) |>
    dplyr::arrange(dplyr::desc(count)) |>
    dplyr::rename(Package = package, `Monthly Downloads` = count) |>
    knitr::kable()
popularity
```
